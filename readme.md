# API Weekend Homework

- Choose an API you like and do something with it :-)

## Learning Objectives

- Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
- Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
- Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it
- Practice using webpack to allow us to structure our front-end code more nicely

## MVP - EarthQuake API

- Make a list of all the earthquakes this week.
- Display the coordinates, magnitude, title.
- Make it a drop down list that you select one from.
- Make the drop down list populate from another list that lists earthquakes 'today', 'this week', 'this month', 'this year'
- Style with CSS

## Extensions

- Google map that centres on coordinates when you choose an earthquake.
- Add a Google map with a marker on the selected quake.
- Add an info box with more info for the earthquake.
- Filter select to only show earthquakes above a certain size (drop down list of sizes?)
- Filter select to only show earthquakes in a region, sub-region????
