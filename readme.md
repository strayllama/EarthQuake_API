# API Weekend Homework

- Choose an API you like and do something with it :-)

## MVP - EarthQuake API

- Display the coordinates, magnitude, title.
- Make it a drop down list that you select one from.
- Make the drop down list populate from another list that lists earthquakes 'today', 'this week', 'this month', 'this year'
- Style with CSS

## Extensions

- Google map that centers on coordinates when you choose an earthquake.
- Add a Google map with a marker on the selected quake.
- Add an info box with more info for the earthquake.
- Filter select to only show earthquakes above a certain size (drop down list of sizes?)
- Filter select to only show earthquakes in a region, sub-region????
